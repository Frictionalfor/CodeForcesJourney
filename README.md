# 🏆 Codeforces Daily Progress — My Competitive Programming Journey

This repository is dedicated to my **Codeforces problem-solving journey**, where I will solve problems every day and document all my solutions.  
My goal is to stay consistent, improve problem-solving skills, and track my growth in competitive programming.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- To solve at least **one Codeforces problem daily**  
- To maintain a **record of every solution** I submit  
- To strengthen **algorithmic thinking and coding skills**  
- To track my **progress and improvement over time**  
- To identify weak areas and revisit problem types I struggle with  
- To stay disciplined and consistent in my competitive programming journey  

---

## 📅 Daily Commitment

I will solve **at least one Codeforces problem every day** without fail.

Each day's entry will include:

- ✔️ Problem ID and name  
- ✔️ Difficulty level (A/B/C etc.)  
- ✔️ Programming language used  
- ✔️ Notes on approach, mistakes, or optimizations  
- ✔️ Key takeaways and what I learned  

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Codeforces Journey

- Build strong **foundational problem-solving skills**  
- Become confident in **A and B level problems**  
- Learn new **algorithms, data structures, and tricks** gradually  
- Improve **speed and accuracy** in solving problems  
- Create a **well-documented repository of solutions** for reference  

---

## 🛠️ Tools I Will Use

- C++ (primary)  
- Python (for easier or practice problems)  
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub to maintain this repository  
- Linux terminal for compiling and running code efficiently

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision

By the end of this journey, I aim to:

- Have **100+ solved problems** on Codeforces documented  
- Be able to solve new problems **confidently and efficiently**  
- Have a complete, **well-organized, and searchable record** of all my solutions  
- Maintain **discipline, consistency, and focus** in my daily learning  
- Be prepared for **contests, interviews, and advanced competitive programming challenges**
