# 🏆 Codeforces Daily Progress — Record File

This file tracks all my daily Codeforces problem solutions.  
Each entry records the problem ID, name, level, language, status, and any important notes.  
I will update this file every day after solving a problem to keep a complete log of my competitive programming journey.
